#### The Problem We’re Solving

Moving to Bangalore for a job? You’ll soon realize that finding a job in the city is a breeze compared to finding a reliable maid or household help. Surprisingly, this isn’t just my story—it’s a shared struggle among many professionals in Bangalore. The demand for skilled individuals for household work far outweighs the supply, leaving people scrambling for solutions.

#### The Solution: Find Your Ginie

To bridge this gap, I envisioned an app that connects professionals directly with customers, making it easier to hire individuals for short-term tasks, long-term contracts, or even subscription-based services. Whether you need a cook, a cleaner, a tutor, or a handyman, Find Your Ginie is here to simplify your life.

#### What Makes Find Your Ginie Stand Out?

* **Geo-Location Search:**
Find nearby professionals with ease using our advanced geo-location feature. No more endless searches or unreliable referrals—just tap and connect.

* **Flexible Pricing:**
Negotiate directly with professionals to agree on a price that works for both parties. No hidden fees, no middlemen—just fair and transparent deals.

* **Real-Time Chat:**
Discuss your requirements, expectations, and timelines directly with the professional through our in-app chat feature. Clear communication leads to better results.

* **Wide Range of Services:**
From household chores to specialized skills, our platform supports a diverse range of professionals. Whether you need a plumber today or a yoga instructor next week, we’ve got you covered.

#### Why Choose Find Your Ginie Over Competitors?
Unlike platforms like Urban Company, which charge premium rates for basic services and lack subscription options, Find Your Ginie empowers you to connect directly with professionals. This not only saves you money but also builds a personal connection with the people you hire.

#### What Are You Waiting For?
Say goodbye to the hassle of finding reliable help and hello to convenience, flexibility, and affordability. Find Your Ginie is here to make your life easier—one tap at a time.

## Repositories

Here’s a list of all the important repositories and services that power our project. Each one plays a unique role in making the system efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.
* **[atom-common-lib](https://github.com/dipakg007/atom-common-lib)** - This repository is the backbone of our project! It houses all the common entity files that are shared across multiple services. Think of it as the central hub for reusable components, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy across the entire system.
* **[atom-search-service](https://github.com/dipakg007/atom-search-service)** - Looking for nearby professionals? This repository has got you covered! The atom-search-service is designed to help users identify and connect with skilled professionals in their vicinity. Whether you need a plumber, tutor, or yoga instructor, this service ensures you find the right person for the job.
* **[atom-discovery-server](https://github.com/dipakg007/atom-discovery-server)** - Meet the Eureka Server of our ecosystem! The atom-discovery-server is responsible for registering and managing all the microservices in our application. It ensures seamless communication between services, making the system robust and reliable.
* **[atom-api-gateway](https://github.com/dipakg007/atom-api-gateway)** - The atom-api-gateway is the gatekeeper of our application. It routes all incoming requests to the appropriate services and handles authentication across the entire project. With this gateway, we ensure a single entry point for all requests, making the system secure and easy to manage.

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
